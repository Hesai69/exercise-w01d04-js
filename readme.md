# Function Exercises 🏋️‍

Take a look at main.js

Write a function to accomplish each task.

Each task has an example of how it would look to use for example:

If the task says

> Write a function called 'greeting' that returns "Good Morning!"

and the example usage says 

```
var message = greeting();
console.log(message) // "Good Morning!"
```

When you run that code with your function it should log "Good Morning!"

# Bonus

Append each answer to the DOM based on the ids in index.html
